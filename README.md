## README

- This is a side project I've been developing off-and-on
- I kept ignoring it because work (and then job hunting) things would take up all my time
- Now, I am in the job hunting phase
- I dislike the "oh wow, look at all of those GitHub commits" approach to GitHub, but hey, you have to play the game
- I was in the middle of converting my work from vanilla HTML / CSS / JS + Bootstrap to AlpineJS + Bootstrap
- It's been a while since I worked on this, so I'm "saving my progress" with the first commit, then I'm wiping several sections and going back to the drawing board
- My goal is to blitz out a simple, functional CRUD app that I'll be using for my biweekly D&D games + a quick, simple, complete application that I can demonstrate during the various kinds of job interviews I may have
- A more professional README is coming later
